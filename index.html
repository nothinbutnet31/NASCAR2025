        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <strong>Midge's Team:</strong><br><br>
            Midge is primed to compete strongly on superspeedways, with multiple Daytona 500 champions on her roster. 
            Road courses are another area where she'll excel, especially with the addition of Shane van Gisbergen, 
            a proven road course expert. Short tracks won't be a concern either, as she has Denny Hamlin and Ryan Preece, 
            both known for their success on tight, short ovals. The real question will be how she fares on the intermediate 
            tracks, where consistency and strategy will be key for success.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <strong>Emilia's Team:</strong><br><br>
            Emilia's 2025 season looks promising, but track performance will be key. Superspeedways like Daytona and 
            Talladega could be strong for the team, with drivers like Austin Dillon and AJ Allmendinger providing solid 
            drafting and positioning skills. Road courses are another strength, where Allmendinger excels, and Cindric's 
            road course experience will be crucial for strong finishes. Short tracks, such as Bristol and Martinsville, 
            could be challenging, as the team lacks a clear short-track specialist, though Larson's versatility may help 
            offset this. Intermediate tracks like Atlanta and Charlotte will likely be a mix of results, with Larson's 
            skillset and Bowman's consistency being assets, but the team may struggle to find consistent speed without 
            strong race-day execution. Overall, a well-balanced strategy will be necessary, with some tracks posing 
            greater challenges than others.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <strong>Heather's Team:</strong><br><br>
            Heather's team is well-balanced across track types, with Chase Elliott and Tyler Reddick excelling on road 
            courses, while Kyle Busch brings consistency across all tracks, especially short tracks and intermediates. 
            Erik Jones is a strong sleeper at Darlington and superspeedways, while Michael McDowell thrives on 
            superspeedways and road courses. The team's biggest strength is versatility, but weaknesses may arise on 
            high-wear tracks and short tracks if Jones and McDowell struggle to keep pace.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <strong>Dan's Team:</strong><br><br>
            Dan's team is built on veteran experience and superspeedway strength, with Brad Keselowski and Joey Logano 
            excelling on drafting tracks like Daytona and Talladega. Chris Buescher adds consistency, especially on 
            short tracks and intermediates, while Noah Gragson and Cole Custer bring potential but uncertainty. The 
            team's biggest strength is its prowess on superspeedways and short tracks, but it may face challenges on 
            road courses and high-wear intermediates if the younger drivers struggle to keep up.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <strong>Grace's Team:</strong><br><br>
            Grace's team is aggressive and high-upside, with Ross Chastain leading the charge on intermediates and road 
            courses. Bubba Wallace adds superspeedway strength, while Chase Briscoe and Daniel Suarez bring road course 
            and short-track potential. Josh Berry, in his second full season but first with Wood Brothers, has shown 
            promise on short tracks. This team's biggest strengths are road courses and superspeedways, but consistency 
            could be a concern, especially on high-wear tracks and intermediates if mistakes or bad luck come into play.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <strong>Edmund's Team:</strong><br><br>
            Edmund's team has a solid mix of experience and rising talent. Ryan Blaney and Christopher Bell provide 
            consistency and speed across intermediates and short tracks. Ty Gibbs adds strong potential, especially on 
            intermediate tracks, while Riley Herbst and Carson Hocevar bring youthful energy with upside, particularly 
            on short tracks and road courses. The team's strength lies in Blaney and Bell's versatility, but it may 
            struggle to maintain consistent performance on superspeedways and high-wear tracks if the younger drivers 
            don't make a significant leap.
